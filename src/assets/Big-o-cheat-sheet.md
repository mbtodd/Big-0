# Big O Cheat Sheet:
-------------------

## Big Os
O(1) Constant - no loops
<!-- O(log N) Logarithmic - usually searching algorithms have log(n) if they are sorted (Binary Search) (not on hash maps though) -->
O(n) Linear - for loops while loops
<!-- O(n*log(n)) Log Linear - Sorting operations usually -->
O(n^2) Quadratic - every element in a collection needs to be compared to ever other element. Two nested loops
<!-- O(2^N) Exponential - recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size N -->
O(n!) Factorial - you are adding a loop for every element.

**Iterating through half a collection is still O(n)
**Two separate collections: O(a * b)
